<p class ="white-text">Recently I watched many movies and these are my very wanting to share to yours.</p>

<p class ="white-text">The Review:</p>
<p2 class="white-text">This movie is adapted from a novel. The novelist is Dame Agatha Mary Clarissa Christie who had a title of Queen of Crime. She is one of my most favorite mystery writers. </p2>
<p2 class ="white-text">When I watched over, I felt very awesome, it’s a highly excellent movie. There are two scenes that I very impressive. </p2>
<p2 class ="white-text">The first one is the end of who is the murder? I really surprised at it. When I watched that, I couldn't believe the murder is …. I don’t want to spoil it, so I’m not write down on this paper. </p2>
<p2 class ="white-text">The second one is the main male character who named Hercule Poirot, saying “I loved one girl.”, I don't remember the English of this words, so I write the words which meaning is similar. When he said that, his expression was very sorrowful. And it's scene makes me feel like the very beloved and precious thing broken. It's never appeared again. Like “心碎”（Sorry, my English is not good, and I worry about writing wrong words, so I write the Chinese.）</p2>
<p class ="white-text">In my opinion, it's a highly recommended movie. </p>
<p2 class ="white-text"> Please don't miss it.</p2>
<p class ="white-text">The second one is "The Shape Of Water" Click the picture, you also can saw the trailer!</p>

<p class ="white-text">The Review:</p>
<p2 class="white-text">I heard early this movie before it come to theaters in Taiwan. When I watched it’s trailer, I couldn't wait to watch this movie. </p2>
<p2 class ="white-text">After watching this movie, it touched me deeply, I really loved it. It’s begins with a man narration. He says, “If I told you about her, the princess without the voice. What would I say?” This beginning is very different to other movies’.</p2>
<p2 class ="white-text">My favorite section is the main actress named Elisa, who wants to get the protagonist out of the laboratory and takes him back to the ocean. For this, she needs her friend’s help. But her friend doesn’t want to do it, because it’s too dangerous to save the protagonist. Thus, Elisa uses her hand to express the words what she wants to say it. “If we do nothing neither are we.” These words touched me deeply and I feel that intense love from Elisa. </p2>
<p2 class ="white-text">Although the movie has an open ending, I believe firmly that they will be together forever.</p2>
<p class ="white-text">The thrid one is "A Dog's Purpose" Click the picture, you also can saw the trailer!</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jLOOCADTGs"><img class="smaller-image"src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1jLOOCADTGs/maxresdefault.jpg"></a>
<p class ="white-text">The Review:</p>
<p2 class="white-text">I will watch this movie, because my roommates highly recommend it. Thus, I watched it, making me feel very moving.</p2>
<p2 class ="white-text">As its name implies, “A Dog’s Purpose” it meant the dog has to do something to achieve the goals. In the movie, there’s a dog who named Bailey learned many thoughts on life by constantly reincarnated, utilizing these to help it’s first master.</p2>
<p2 class ="white-text">At the end of the movie, Bailey met it’s first master again, wanted to make he be happiness and not be lonely. So it found the woman who was the master’s love, making them met again and having a conversation. Then they got back together and married, starting their happiness life.</p2>
<p2 class ="white-text">It’s a funny, moving and warm movie, you will be laugh or have a possible to be cry. I deeply impressed on it.</p2>
